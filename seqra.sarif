                                "text": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Java servlet applications occurs when the server makes HTTP or other network requests based on user‑supplied input (such as a URL) without proper validation.

In Spring MVC/Boot applications, this often happens when controllers return a `redirect:` view or `RedirectView` using user-supplied data. Attackers can exploit this to trick users into visiting malicious sites via URLs that appear to be from a trusted domain, or to chain redirects into other attacks.\n\nVulnerable code sample\n\n```java\n@Controller\npublic class RedirectController {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/redirect\")\n    public String redirect(@RequestParam(\"url\") String url) {\n        // VULNERABLE: unvalidated user-controlled URL\n        return \"redirect:\" + url;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOr with `RedirectView`:\n\n```java\n@Controller\npublic class RedirectController {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/redirect\")\n    public RedirectView redirect(@RequestParam(\"url\") String url) {\n        // VULNERABLE: unvalidated user-controlled URL\n        return new RedirectView(url);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo remediate this issue, avoid redirecting to arbitrary URLs derived directly from user input. Prefer mapping short, controlled identifiers to known internal routes, or if external redirects are required, strictly validate against a whitelist of allowed hosts and schemes.\n\nExample: safer internal redirects using a target name instead of a full URL:\n\n```java\n@Controller\npublic class SafeRedirectController {\n\n    private static final Map<String, String> ALLOWED_TARGETS = Map.of(\n        \"home\",    \"/home\",\n        \"profile\", \"/user/profile\",\n        \"orders\",  \"/orders/list\"\n    );\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/redirect\")\n    public String redirect(\n            @RequestParam(value = \"target\", required = false) String target) {\n\n        // Default safe page\n        String path = ALLOWED_TARGETS.getOrDefault(target, \"/home\");\n\n        // Only internal paths, no scheme/host\n        return \"redirect:\" + path;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nExample: if you must support external redirects, validate against an allowlist of domains:\n\n```java\n@Controller\npublic class ExternalRedirectController {\n\n    private static final Set<String> ALLOWED_DOMAINS = Set.of(\n        \"example.com\",\n        \"trusted-partner.com\"\n    );\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/external-redirect\")\n    public String externalRedirect(\n            @RequestParam(\"url\") String url,\n            HttpServletRequest request) {\n\n        try {\n            URI uri = new URI(url);\n            String host   = uri.getHost();\n            String scheme = uri.getScheme();\n\n            if (host != null\n                    && (\"http\".equalsIgnoreCase(scheme)\n                        || \"https\".equalsIgnoreCase(scheme))\n                    && ALLOWED_DOMAINS.contains(host.toLowerCase())) {\n\n                // Safe: host and scheme validated against allowlist\n                return \"redirect:\" + uri.toString();\n            }\n        } catch (URISyntaxException e) {\n            // fall through to safe default\n        }\n\n        // Fallback to a safe internal page on any failure or disallowed host\n        return \"redirect:/home\";\n    }\n}\n```"
